# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

🔍 Observation and Summary of Findings from the Heatmap Code (gender_submission.csv)
📌 Code Purpose
The code reads the gender_submission.csv file from the Titanic dataset and generates a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the numerical variables.

✅ Variables Involved
The dataset contains only two columns:

PassengerId – a unique identifier for each passenger.

Survived – binary indicator (1 if survived, 0 if not).

📊 Heatmap Output
The heatmap displays a correlation matrix:

Values range between -1 (perfect negative correlation) and 1 (perfect positive correlation).

Diagonal values are always 1 (a variable perfectly correlates with itself).

🧠 Key Observations
Weak Correlation:

The correlation between PassengerId and Survived is close to 0, indicating no meaningful linear relationship.

This makes sense because PassengerId is just a sequential identifier, not a feature that influences survival.

Heatmap Simplicity:

Since there are only two numeric columns, the matrix is very minimal (2x2), mostly highlighting the lack of meaningful interaction between the fields.

📝 Summary of Findings
The gender_submission.csv dataset is limited in analytical value for feature-based survival prediction, as it contains only ID and outcome.

PassengerId should not be used as a predictor in modeling, as it carries no causal information.

For meaningful correlation insights, a more feature-rich dataset like train.csv should be used (as done in other parts of your analysis).
